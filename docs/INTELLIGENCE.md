# CourtVision Intelligence Layer

> **Funnel position:** this is **stage 2 (SIGNALS)** feeding the model stack, and it's also
> where **stage 6 (INTELLIGENCE)** writes back. See the full funnel in [../README.md](../README.md)
> and [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md). Cross-links:
> [PUBLIC_EVIDENCE.md](PUBLIC_EVIDENCE.md) · [KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md).

The intelligence layer sits between raw CV tracking and the prediction models. It is **80 artifacts
(~10 MB of parquet + json)** derived from broadcast-video tracking, NBA Stats API, and play-by-play
microstructure. Every artifact answers a specific question the prediction stack would otherwise have
to guess at: *who is this player right now, what scheme is the opponent imposing, how does this
matchup behave, is the model confident here?*

Artifacts are gitignored (`data/intelligence/`) — regenerable from raw tracking + NBA Stats. This
doc is the public-facing **manifest**: what exists, what's in each file, how it plugs in.

> **Status (2026-06-11):** 80 artifacts populated. Coverage is uneven — some layers (lineup
> chemistry, similarity index) span thousands of rows; others (officials player-sensitivity,
> absence-effects) are early and small. Per-artifact row counts are listed so maturity of each
> signal is legible at a glance.

> **Scale summary:** 291,625-pair matchup matrix · 690-node knowledge graph (660 player + 30 team)
> · 1,249 per-player dossiers (28 statistical categories, archetype-labeled) · 30 team scheme cards.
> See **[docs/PLAYER_INTELLIGENCE.md](PLAYER_INTELLIGENCE.md)** for the full showcase with real
> dossier examples (Jokić, SGA, Sam Hauser) and honest scope statement.

Concrete examples of how a prediction call consumes intelligence:

- **Prop model for tonight's LeBron PTS** → loads `current_form_profiles` (trend tag + driver),
  `matchup_deviations` (LeBron-vs-MIN delta), `per_player_confidence` (volatility-adjusted Kelly
  multiplier), `officials_player_sensitivity` (ref tightness sensitivity), `pace_adjusted_cv`
  (pace-normalized baseline).
- **In-play endQ3 winprob** → consumes `ingame_momentum` (H1 → H2 delta vector), `clutch_cv_split`
  (clutch elevators vs. shrinkers), `quarter_profiles` (per-quarter velocity baseline),
  `coaching_adjustments` (whether the trailing team is mid-adjustment).
- **Bet filter / sizing** → reads `cv_quality_per_game` (gate by tracking quality),
  `confidence_curves` (per-EV-decile reliability), `anomaly_log` (suppress bets on players
  currently outside their baseline).
- **Possession simulation** → the player-level Monte Carlo (`src/sim/`) reads
  `data/cache/team_system/{player_rates, team_rates}` plus scheme / clutch / rest context tables
  as per-possession rate multipliers, so an intelligence finding propagates directly into simulated
  game outcomes and same-game-parlay joint pricing.

**The loop closes here.** The self-improving discovery loop (`src/loop/`) doesn't only *consume*
this layer — it *extends* it. ARM A writes new `signals/<name>.py` leaf signals (each gated by
expanding WF + null-shuffle permutation + Benjamini-Hochberg FDR); ARM B writes new `intel/*.py`
atlas sections back into the player profiles. Artifacts are added only after passing the gate, and
most candidates are correctly rejected.

**Honest caveat on betting value:** The intelligence layer's signal currently moves SHAP importance
only through the prop models, where it contributes to accurate prediction. On point features, that
accuracy gain does not translate to a betting edge (market efficient on closing lines). The real
value of this layer is at the joint/in-game/freshness frontier — and as a basketball-understanding
and scouting resource. See [CEILING.md](CEILING.md) for the ceiling analysis.

## What's honest about this layer

- **Row counts above are the truth.** Some layers (similarity 26K, shot-clock buckets 8.5K,
  lineup chemistry 4.7K) are mature. Others (absence-effects 5, officials player-sensitivity 0)
  are scaffolded but sparse — the framework exists; the signal isn't fully populated yet.
- **Significance is recorded where applicable** — `t_stat`, `p_value`, `p_value_adj` columns live
  in the parquets. Most signals are corrected; a few sub-100-row tables aren't significant on their
  own and only earn weight when stacked.
- **CV quality gating is real.** `cv_quality_per_game.parquet` (3,560 game-slots) feeds the
  bet-construction filter — a prediction on a game with `homography_valid_rate < 0.6` is
  downweighted regardless of model confidence.
- **The intelligence layer regenerates from raw tracking + NBA Stats.** Nothing here is
  hand-edited. Every signal is reproducible from a fresh `data/` snapshot.
- **SHAP = 0 in production today.** The artifacts are correct and complete; they do not yet produce
  measurable lift in the prop models. This is the current honest state — do not overclaim.

## Limitations

1. **Officials player-sensitivity is empty (0 rows).** Per-player ref-tightness deltas aren't
   passing the significance gate yet — needs more games per ref crew.
2. **Absence-effects has 5 rows.** Star-out / beneficiary attribution only fires on very clean
   absence games; most are confounded by simultaneous injuries.
3. **Similarity index covers 1,214 player-games.** Earlier games + non-tracked games have no
   neighbors.
4. **Compound candidates (atlas A × atlas B) are 10 rows.** Combinatorial search is gated to
   high-prior pairs; broadening is queued.
5. **Several layers don't have a public R²/Brier number** because they're not standalone models —
   they're inputs to models. The validation surface is the downstream prop/winprob walk-forward.
6. **CV features SHAP ≈ 0 in production.** The plumbing is complete; the lift is gated on the
   80-game retrain. Current state: credible thesis, zero demonstrated edge.

## Reproducing

Builders live under `scripts/intelligence/` (and a few in `src/intelligence/`). Top-level driver
is `scripts/intelligence/build_all.py`; per-layer scripts can be run individually. Required inputs:
`data/tracking/*` (CV tracking), `data/nba/*` (gamelogs),
`data/cache/inplay_pbp_microstructure.parquet` (microstructure).

Regeneration takes ~25 min on the dev box for the full 80-artifact pass. The artifacts are kept
out of git both because they're large and because they encode the proprietary derivation; the
**schema and counts on this page are the public commitment**.
